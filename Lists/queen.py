# In chess it is known that it is possible to place 8 queens on an 8Ã—8 chess
#  board such that none of them can attack another. Given a placement of 8 
#  queens on the board, determine if there is a pair of queens that can attach 
#  each other on the next move. Print the word NO if no queen can attack another,
#   otherwise print YES. The input consists of eight coordinate pairs, one pair per line, 
#   with each pair
#  giving the position of a queen on a standard chess board with rows and 
#  columns numbered starting at 1.
