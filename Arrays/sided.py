"""Given an integer n, create a two-dimensional array of size(n√ón) and populate it as follows, with spaces between each character:
The positions on the minor diagonal(from the upper right to the lower left corner) receive 1 .
The positions above this diagonal recieve 0 .
The positions below the diagonal receive 2 .
Print the elements of the resulting array.
